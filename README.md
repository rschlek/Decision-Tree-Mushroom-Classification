# Decision-Tree-Mushroom-Classification

This was a project I completed for CS330 (Intro to AI) where I built a decision tree model using SKLearn to attempt to predict the toxicity of mushrooms based on a dataset of physical mushroom characteristics. I also was able to experiment and see the effects that different depths, number of estimators, and model criterions had on the model accuracy.
